# üôè Contributions
PocketSmali is both extendable and modular. To add handlers for other SMALI instructions, create a Python file in the ```opcode_handlers``` subfolder. Inside of this file, create a method that handles a specific instruction type - this method should take the parameters ```(opcode, operands, runtime_env, emulator)```. Then add to the ```dict_of_opcode_handlers``` dictionary in the Emulator class with the key being the name of the instruction and the value being a reference to your created method for handling it.
